<p>
    Online learning from demonstration algorithms, such as
DAgger, can learn policies for problems where the system dynamics and
the cost function are unknown. However, during learning, they impose a
burden on supervisors to respond to queries each time the robot
encounters new states while executing its current best policy.  
Algorithms such as 
MMD-IL reduce supervisor burden
by filtering queries with insufficient discrepancy in distribution and
maintaining multiple policies.  We introduce the SHIV algorithm
(Svm-based reduction in Human InterVention), which converges to 
a single policy and reduces supervisor
burden in non-stationary high dimensional state distributions. To
facilitate scaling and outlier rejection, filtering is based on
distance to an approximate level set boundary defined by a One Class
support vector machine. We report on experiments in three contexts: 1) a
driving simulator with a 27,936 dimensional visual feature space, 2) a
push-grasping in clutter simulation with a 22 dimensional state space,
and 3) physical surgical needle insertion with a 16 dimensional state
space.  Results suggest that SHIV can efficiently learn 
policies with equivalent performance requiring up to 70\% fewer queries.
